The new version's texture is less dense and more like a hybrid between a gel and a creamy lotion. On the plus side, it layers much better in my opinion than the old version, meaning that it layers well over the Skin Recovery Toner and a combination of Skin Recovery Moisturizer (non spf version) and a drop of Hyaluronic Acid mixed together can be applied over the BHA without balling up. That combination of products has been effective at keeping my skin hydrated and smooth.

I received samples of the 5% lotion with my order and that does the same thing. So, I'm back to my regular moisturizer in the morning. 

I've started using it at night instead, applying it on a clean face and I do like it for that purpose.

It is nice as a night application; I do notice my skin is smooth and the tone is nice in the morning. I have combination/oily skin and it doesn't make that worse.

5,True,"This is a very strong retinol and vitamin C product. Start out with just once a week and build up to every day or every other day. I mix mine with CeraVe PM lotion because this cream is not moisturizing at all. This makes it a bit more mild too. Caution around the eye area, it made my skin sensitive there. I can only use it at night because the texture is so silicone-y that it balls up with sunscreen during the day. I don't know why they call this a moisturizer... It should be marketed as a strong treatment. It burns slightly for a moment but the other ingredients buffer the strong retinol so I haven't had any peeling.

Understandably, the sun screen effect will be lowered as compared to when you apply a sunblock after your moisturizer, but it is not a big deal if you are not someone who goes out under the sun very often. As mentioned, because it has a 2-in-1 function, that makes this a recommended  product for those who have very oily skin and easily pore-clogging skin(like mine).
However, it gets 4 stars only because it is not mattifying, AT ALL.

Still this is my everyday go to product because it relieves my sensitive, itchy and yet blemish-prone oily skin, most likely because of the main skin soothing and benefiting ingredients in it.

I seldom find a moisturizer+sunblock which suits me well(despite the little pore clogging greasiness it gives, but don't use my extremely oily skin which is still super oily even though I'm past 30 as a standard, I'm sure it will not clog pores for people with only slightly oily skin) and I hope Paula Choice will keep this product in their catalogue for a long long time to come.",RaYZgY6mOnPhnheUsv2M,4,lszjulianne@gmail.com,Juli,6130,2018-03-06T18:15:01+08:00,True

But much to my surprise, my face didn't break out. In fact, I think it reduced the amount of acne I was getting.

And best of all, this product gave me plump and soft looking skin. I can actually see the difference when I use it judiciously every night - my skin has never looked this good.

this product turns very impressive, on the oil T zone and its matte finish is the best.

But it turns out just fine on my Asian skin. I can't see it at all after absorption. Need to mention, I could occasionally wipe out tilt after heavy sweat. 
I also use this product on eye area. Unlike ladies, I don't have other mark-ups which may contain SPF. And I am lazy to put on other SPF product area eyes. So I just put this on. So far, it works well. No discomfort thus far.

no white cast

no sticky or oily feel

CONS:
cannot apply around the eyes, it made my eyelids burn
tends to pill/ball up, which means i cannot reapply throughout the day because the new layer will rub off the old layer and i'll get patchy coverage, and i cannot apply makeup smoothly over it. some ppl might say ""of course you're not meant to apply makeup over it, this is a MEN's product"". but if you look at the ingredients, it's exactly the same as the SKIN BALANCING ULTRA-SHEER DAILY DEFENSE SPF 30 that is marketed to women, so i don't think i'm unreasonable to expect to be able to put makeup over this product.

I live in FL and I can use SPF for the sun, but I can't really avoid the heat, so I'm constantly trying to knock down flares).
